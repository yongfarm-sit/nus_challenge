## Inconsistencies and Errors

1. **Total Cash Calculation Error**: The total cash is calculated as 898,402. However, adding up the individual cash accounts (1000 Cash, 1010 Checking, 1020 Savings, 1030 Petty Cash) gives a total of 899,401. This is inconsistent with the stated total cash and is a violation of SSA-315 which requires accurate representation of financial data.

2. **Total Other Current Assets Calculation Error**: The total other current assets is calculated as 274,321. However, adding up the individual other current assets (1310 Prepaid Rent, 1320 Prepaid Liability Insurance) gives a total of 274,321. This is inconsistent with the stated total other current assets and is a violation of SSA-315 which requires accurate representation of financial data.

3. **Total Current Assets Calculation Error**: The total current assets is calculated as 5,356,121. However, adding up the individual current assets (Total Cash, 1100 Accounts Receivable, 1200 Work in Process, Total Other Current Assets) gives a total of 5,357,120. This is inconsistent with the stated total current assets and is a violation of SSA-315 which requires accurate representation of financial data.

4. **Total Equity Calculation Error**: The total equity is calculated as 3,970,799. However, adding up the individual equity accounts (3000 Capital Stock, 3100 Treasury Stock, 3200 Retained Earnings) gives a total of 3,971,799. This is inconsistent with the stated total equity and is a violation of SSA-315 which requires accurate representation of financial data.
